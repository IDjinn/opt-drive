# opt-drive

Simple files/folder manager swap between drives. 
Manage recent used files in NVME SSD to long term storage on SSD Sata or HDD

### How it does work?

opt-drive first scan and indexes files and folders based on provided settings and then
check if any files is not used anymore, then it does move to other drive.
Works in opposite way, when it's too much used in other drive, move to fast one
to fast access and reability.

With a lot configurations, you keep system fast as you can, without bottlenecks.
